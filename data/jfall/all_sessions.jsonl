And because we often try to adopt new ideas, that code base has gone through many of the ideas of the last 25 years, including the hype where tests written in Cucumber \"would allow everyone to write tests\" (and of course spare us developers the task of having to do that ourselves).As with many hypes, that did not turn out quite as expected. Which resulted in a big set of UI tests that actually are quite fragile, will all kinds of tight coupling to the screens. Hindsight is always 20/20.So we recently revamped our UI tests and took a completely different approach: can we write test that have no coupling to the screens at all? Who describe the test in a functional or declarative style? That seems like a fairly trivial idea, but we had some worries like will those tests be fine grained enough? And cover all the scenario's that need to be tested? And of course we very much would like to prevent the wild growth that is present in the current tests, both in number of step definitions, as in ways to write the steps.In this talk we would like to show you how that attempt went. What issues we countered, how we solved them, and what architecture and framework we used.

However, they present challenges, such as ensuring data diversity, maintaining quality, facilitating validation, and ensuring long-term maintainability.While many engineers are familiar with these challenges, they often resort to non-specialized tools like the RandomStringUtils class from Apache Commons or the Random class, concatenating fixed data with it. This approach lacks scalability and may not yield a valid dataset.Thankfully we have DataFaker, a library for Java and Kotlin to generate fake data, based on generators, that can be very helpful when generating test data to fill a database, to generate data for a stress test, or to anonymize data from production services.With practical examples, you will learn how to generate data based on:- different or multiple locales- random enum values- different generators like address, code (books), currency, date and time, finance, internet, measurement, money, name, time, and others- custom (data) providers- sequences (collections and stream)- date formats- expressions- transformations- unique valuesIn the end, patterns for generating better data like the Test Data Factory will also take place to add more control to the data generation.", "room": "Room 5", "time": "Thu 8:00 am - 8:50 am", "tags": ["Technical Session", "Java Language", "Beginner"]}

Vector search got a jump start with the rise of LLMs and RAG.This workshop aims to build a high-quality retriever, integrate the retriever into your LLM solution and measure the overall quality of your RAG system.The workshop uses our Rag4j/Rag4p framework, which we created especially for workshops. It is easy to learn, so you can focus on understanding and building the details of the components during the workshop. You experiment with different chunking mechanisms (sentence, max tokens, semantic). After that, you use various strategies to construct the context for the LLM (TopN, Window, Document, Hierarchical).

You're not alone! The reality of working within such a team can differ from expectations. Often, the greatest challenge for developers isn't the actual work, but rather navigating the distance, understanding cultural disparities, and maintaining meaningful connections with team members.Today, whether we work in Amsterdam or New Delhi, Brussels or Beijing, we are all part of a global network where success requires traversing vastly different cultural realities. But how do you deliver constructive feedback to colleagues from Asia, America, or Europe? And why does your Indian team really need an hour for lunch? Also, do you know the secret that a \u2018NO\u2019 can come in many disguises?In this session, I will share personal stories and practical strategies from my years of working with multicultural teams.

However, the challenge extends beyond simply calling an LLM from a Java application. How does one build an end-to-end platform from data to a working application? This is where Ray and Kubernetes come into play. Ray, an open-source framework, simplifies distributed machine learning, while Kubernetes streamlines deployment.This deep-dive session will explore how to combine Java, LangChain4j, Ray, and Kubernetes for ML applications.
